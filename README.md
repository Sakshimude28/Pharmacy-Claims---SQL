This project delves into the realm of data normalization and database design, using a dataset of pharmacy claims from an insurance company managed by a Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM).
The primary objective is to transform this raw data into a structured, relational database format that meets the Third Normal Form (3NF) standards.
Through this process, we aim to create a test database that will facilitate the development of common SQL query reports, setting a foundation for efficient data analysis and management. 
This initial stage is crucial for ensuring a smooth transition to a fully functional data warehouse in a real-world business environment.
